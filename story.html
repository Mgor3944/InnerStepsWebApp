                <h1>Alex and the Ticklish Giant</h1>
                <p>Alex hadn't planned on spending his Tuesday afternoon inside a giant's mouth, but here he was, squishing around on a massive tongue next to a neon green cat named Hungry.</p>
                <p>Hungry's fur glowed like a nightlight in the dark, wet space, making the huge teeth around them look like a forest of white towers.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="page2" class="page hidden">
                <h4>Alex and the Ticklish Giant</h4>
                <p>"You know," Hungry said, giving his paw a quick wash like this was just another normal day, "when I said we should explore the Whispering Mountains, I didn't mean we should explore the inside of a giant's mouth."</p>
                <p>Alex gave his cat friend an annoyed look, trying not to slip on the squishy tongue under his feet. "Well, maybe if someone hadn't chased that glowing butterfly right into a sleeping giant's mouthâ€”"</p>
            </div>
            <div id="page3" class="page hidden">
                <h4>Alex and the Ticklish Giant</h4>
                <p>The whole place suddenly shook like a bouncy castle, and both boy and cat stumbled as the giant started to wake up. </p>
                <p>They'd been looking for a super special treasure - the Crown of Unbreakable Will - when everything had gone wrong. Now, instead of finding the crown, they were trying really hard not to become giant tooth-paste.</p>
