# InnerSteps simple read me file for Matt

**INNERSTEPS WEB APP**
Our AI-powered, anxiety support program provides families with a series of interactive picture/audio story adventures breaking down therapy into bite-sized lessons that help children build practical coping strategies, and confidence that suit their unique needs and reading level.

**PURPOSE OF THE BUILD**

This MVP is designed to test how much personalisation is required to make the child feel like the story is for them. The most simplist way to test this is to procedurally generate the text of the story and then manually customise the images to match the child's profile description.

**NICE TO HAVE'S**

1. Look into open source lofi sleep sounds to play in the background of the story. 
        Should start as soon as app loads and continue playing through the story. 
        Add a simple button to pause/play the sound, and a volume slider to adjust the volume. 
        Include a simple notification which asks to turn on sound for the best experience.

2. Look into gamification elements such as game-like buttons and simple sounds (both in onboarding and app) 

3. Add a log out button to the home screen (top left) and a coin system (top right) to unlock custom picturebook printed and sent to child!
        Could add simple tabs in between stories to show practise questions... incase users want to exit and come back to them
